# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive textbook on Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. This textbook bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and embodied intelligence, providing you with the knowledge needed to understand and develop next-generation robotic systems.

## About This Textbook

This textbook is structured into four comprehensive modules:

- **Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Master ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, and how to control humanoid robots using Python.
- **Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Explore simulation environments with Gazebo and Unity for robot development and testing.
- **Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)** - Understand NVIDIA Isaac Sim, SLAM navigation, and perception pipelines for intelligent robots.
- **Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** - Integrate LLMs with robotics for advanced human-robot interaction and task execution.

Each module builds upon the previous to create a comprehensive understanding of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics.
