# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to the first module of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces you to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware that serves as the "nervous system" for most robotic applications.

## Overview

ROS 2 is a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes, topics, and services
- Implement robot control using Python and rclpy
- Work with URDF for humanoid robot descriptions

## Topics Covered

This module covers:
- ROS 2 architecture and concepts
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Python rclpy client library
- URDF for humanoid robots

Let's begin exploring the foundation of modern robotics development!
