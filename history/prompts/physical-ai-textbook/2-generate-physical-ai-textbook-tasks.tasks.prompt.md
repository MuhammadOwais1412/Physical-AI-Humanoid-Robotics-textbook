# Generate Physical AI Textbook Tasks

## Original Prompt

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Summary

Generated a comprehensive task list for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project following the Spec-Kit Plus methodology. The tasks.md file includes:

- Setup phase for Docusaurus project initialization
- Foundational phase for core infrastructure
- 7 user stories organized by priority (P1-P7)
- Each user story includes content creation, exercises, and integration tasks
- Proper checklist format with task IDs, story labels, and file paths
- Dependencies and execution order defined
- Parallel execution opportunities identified
- Implementation strategy for MVP and incremental delivery

The tasks follow the required format with checkboxes, sequential IDs, story labels where appropriate, and specific file paths for each task.

## Outcome

Successfully created a detailed, executable task list that enables independent implementation and testing of each user story in the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook project. The tasks are organized to support both sequential and parallel development approaches.
