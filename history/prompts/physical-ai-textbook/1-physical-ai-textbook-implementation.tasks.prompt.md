## RESPONSE_TEXT

Successfully completed the implementation of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook by executing tasks from the tasks.md file. This included:

1. Completed all remaining foundational tasks (T008, T009, T013):
   - Configured Algolia search functionality
   - Set up versioning system for textbook editions
   - Created custom components for textbook features (exercises, diagrams)

2. Completed all User Story 4 tasks (Module 4: Vision-Language-Action):
   - Created module-4-vla directory structure
   - Implemented comprehensive content for voice commands with Whisper
   - Created detailed LLM-ROS integration guide
   - Developed capstone project documentation
   - Designed humanoid interaction patterns
   - Added VLA-related code examples
   - Created capstone exercises
   - Updated navigation in sidebars.ts

3. Created custom React components for exercises and diagrams to enhance the textbook experience.

4. All tasks were marked as completed [X] in the tasks.md file as they were implemented.

The implementation follows the spec-driven development approach with proper documentation, code examples, and exercises that align with the course objectives of bridging digital AI and physical robotics systems.
