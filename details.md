### The Course Details  
**Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**  
Focus: AI Systems in the Physical World — Embodied Intelligence.  
Goal: Bridge the gap between digital brains and physical bodies. Students will deploy AI to control humanoid robots in both simulation and real-world setups.

### Quarter Overview  
Students explore Physical AI: AI systems that interpret the real world, obey physics, and interact with humans.  
Technologies include ROS 2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, Unity, and VLA systems.

### Module 1 — The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)  
- ROS 2 nodes, topics, services  
- Python → ROS control via rclpy  
- URDF for humanoids  

### Module 2 — The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)  
- Physics simulation & collisions  
- Sensor simulation: LiDAR, depth, IMU  
- Human-robot interaction environments via Unity  

### Module 3 — The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)  
- Isaac Sim synthetic data  
- Isaac ROS VSLAM, navigation, Nav2  
- Biped locomotion path planning  

### Module 4 — Vision-Language-Action (VLA)  
- Whisper voice commands  
- LLM → ROS action translation  
- Capstone: Autonomous humanoid with voice → plan → navigate → identify → manipulate  

### Why Physical AI Matters  
Humanoids thrive because their form matches our environment. This course shifts students from digital AI toward embodied intelligence.

### Learning Outcomes  
- Physical AI principles
